toggle25 lets Chrome users select and temporarily remove any element from a webpage using keyboard shortcuts.  
Unlike standard "hide" methods, it removes elements from the DOM, preventing interference from nested JavaScript.  
Elements can be restored instantly. The extension features a clean UI, hover highlighting, and toast notifications.
